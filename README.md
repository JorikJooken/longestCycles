# Longest cycles
This repository contains code and data related to the paper: "Improved asymptotic upper bounds for the minimum number of pairwise distinct longest cycles in regular graphs" (available on arXiv [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.17469.pdf)). People interested in the current repository might also be interested in [this repository](https://github.com/JorikJooken/hamiltonian_cycles) about counting hamiltonian cycles.

The files "18VertexGraph.g6", "24VertexGraph.g6" and "60VertexGraph.g6" each contain a graph that is described in that paper, represented in graph6 format.


### countLongestCycles.cpp
The program can be compiled by the following command:
```bash
g++ -g -std=c++11 -O3 countLongestCycles.cpp -o countLongestCyclesExecutable
```

The program reads a list of graphs in graph6 format and outputs each graph, followed by a line containing the number of pairwise distinct longest cycles. By default, hamiltonian graphs are skipped. This default setting can be overwritten by passing the parameter "0" to the executable.


Invoking the command

```bash
./countLongestCyclesExecutable < 24VertexGraph.g6
```

will result in the following output:

```
WY??WIG?G??B?ACO_A??D?AG?CWO??A?CC?A?_?]???E??@
4
```

This indicates that the graph is non-hamiltonian and has 4 pairwise distinct longest cycles.

Similarly, invoking the command

```bash
./countLongestCyclesExecutable < 60VertexGraph.g6
```

will result in the following output:

```
{HEHGDH?G?_@?P??_AG?HC?E?HG????????@???G???_??P???H????_??HG???@????C????G???AG????C????P????@G???_?_??O@H??????????????????W?????A_????????????A??????G??????G?????AG???_???G??????????G???@???????A??????CO_??????A????????D???????AG???????CW??????O????????A?C??????C?A???????_?W?????E?????????E??@
1
```

This indicates that this graph has a unique longest cycle.

The 18-vertex graph from the file "18VertexGraph.g6" is a hamiltonian graph. If we want to output the number of pairwise distinct hamiltonian cycles in this graph, we need to overwrite the default setting that hamiltonian graphs are skipped. This can be done by passing "0" as a parameter to the executable.

Invoking the command
```bash
./countLongestCyclesExecutable 0 < 18VertexGraph.g6
```

will result in the following output:

```
QhEHGDH?G?_@?P??_AG?HC?E?HG
1
```

This indicates that this graph has a unique hamiltonian cycle.
